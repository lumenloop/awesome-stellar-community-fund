## About the SCF

The Stellar Community Fund awards grants to projects that grow the Stellar ecosystem. Reviewers evaluate applications across dimensions like integration fit, technical architecture, team readiness, traction, and budget proportionality. The resources in this repo help standardize and streamline that review process.
