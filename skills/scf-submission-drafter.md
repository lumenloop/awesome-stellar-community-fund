# SCF Submission Drafter

## Overview

Guides teams through writing a complete SCF Build Award application, section by section. Asks the right questions, fills gaps, and produces a submission draft that matches the patterns of funded projects.

## When to Use

- A team wants help writing their SCF application from scratch
- A team has a partial draft and needs help completing or improving it
- A team wants feedback on whether their submission is ready

## Process

### Phase 1: Discovery

Before writing anything, gather the essential context. Ask the team:

1. **What are you building?** Get a one-sentence description. If the team can't explain it in one sentence, help them sharpen it. The one-line test: can someone outside your team understand what you build, for whom, and why it needs Stellar?

2. **Which track?** Determine if this is Integration, Open, or RFP Track:
   - Integration Track → core purpose is integrating an existing Stellar building block from the eligible list
   - Open Track → building something novel (new protocol, infrastructure, on-chain primitive)
   - RFP Track → responding to a published Request for Proposals

3. **Why Stellar?** This is the most important question. The team must articulate which Stellar capabilities they depend on — Soroban contracts, SEPs, asset issuance, anchors, network finality — and why they're essential, not interchangeable. If the project could work equally well without Stellar, flag this immediately.

4. **Who is the team?** Named people, relevant experience, public profiles. Anonymous or vague teams are a red flag in reviews.

5. **What exists today?** Code, prototypes, deployed contracts, demos, prior Stellar work. If nothing exists yet, the team needs to build something before submitting — at minimum a testnet deployment.

6. **What's the evidence of demand?** Users, metrics, waitlist signups, partner commitments, letters of intent. Concrete numbers, not vague claims.

7. **What's the budget range?** Get a rough sense. The median funded Build Award is $93,700. The middle 50% fall between $60K and $128K. Rejected submissions average $102K — higher than funded ones.

### Phase 2: Drafting

Work through each section of the submission. Use the [Submission Template](../docs/submission-template.md) as the structural backbone.

#### Project Description
- Lead with the problem, not the solution
- Make Stellar's role unmistakable in the first paragraph
- Use plain language — no buzzwords or jargon
- Include the one-sentence description as the opener

#### Technical Architecture
- Include a system architecture diagram (describe in text what the diagram should show)
- Detail Soroban contract design: contract names, entry points, state model, cross-contract calls
- Show data flow from user action through Stellar network and back
- Cover security: key management, access control, audit plan
- Reference the [Technical Architecture Guide](../docs/technical-architecture.md) for completeness

#### Team
- Name every team member with role, relevant experience, and links (GitHub, LinkedIn, prior projects)
- Highlight any prior Stellar/Soroban experience
- If the team has delivered prior SCF awards, emphasize this

#### Deliverables
Structure deliverables using the funded project format:

```
**Deliverable N — [Name]**
- **Description:** What you will build or deliver.
- **Completion criteria:** How a reviewer confirms it's done.
- **Estimated completion:** Date or duration.
- **Budget:** Cost for this deliverable.
```

Key rules:
- 2–4 deliverables per tranche
- T0 must be technical (code interacting with Stellar/Soroban)
- T3 must include UX readiness (functional interfaces, usable onboarding)
- Each deliverable must be independently verifiable from outside the team
- Show clear progression: T0 → T1 → T2 → T3

Reference the [Writing Deliverables Guide](../docs/writing-deliverables.md) for category-specific examples.

#### Budget
Build bottom-up from deliverables:

```
| Deliverable | Role | Rate | Effort | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Soroban contracts | Senior dev | $X/week | Y weeks | $Z |
```

Key rules:
- Include rates and effort for every line item
- No large marketing line items (SCF funds building, not marketing)
- Factor in LaunchKit audit credits at T2
- Map budget to tranches (10% / 20% / 30% / 40%)

Reference the [Writing Budgets Guide](../docs/writing-budgets.md) for rate benchmarks and funded examples.

#### Traction
- If live: monthly active users, transaction volume, growth rate, retention — with verification links
- If pre-launch: waitlist numbers with collection periods, named partner commitments, user research findings
- Set concrete adoption targets: "500 MAU within 3 months of mainnet launch" not "grow our user base"

Reference the [Proving Traction Guide](../docs/proving-traction.md).

### Phase 3: Review

After the draft is complete, run through the pre-submit checklist:

- [ ] One-sentence description is clear to someone outside the team
- [ ] Stellar's role is essential and explicitly explained
- [ ] Architecture includes diagrams, data flows, and Soroban/SEP details
- [ ] Team members are named with relevant experience and links
- [ ] Traction evidence is specific and verifiable
- [ ] Deliverables use the structured format
- [ ] T0 includes a technical deliverable interacting with Stellar/Soroban
- [ ] T3 includes UX readiness
- [ ] Budget is bottom-up with rates, effort, and per-tranche breakdown
- [ ] Budget is proportional to scope
- [ ] LaunchKit benefits factored in and not double-counted
- [ ] No large marketing or contingency line items
- [ ] Every link works
- [ ] Submission is self-contained
- [ ] Correct track selected

Flag anything that doesn't pass. Help the team fix it before they submit.

## Output Format

Produce the complete draft in the structure of the [Submission Template](../docs/submission-template.md), with:

1. All sections filled in based on team input
2. Inline notes marked with `[DRAFT NOTE: ...]` where the team needs to provide more detail, verify a claim, or make a decision
3. A summary of strengths and gaps at the end

## What Not to Do

- **Don't fabricate claims.** If the team doesn't have traction, don't invent metrics. Help them articulate what they do have honestly.
- **Don't inflate scope to justify a higher budget.** Help the team right-size.
- **Don't gloss over weaknesses.** If Stellar integration feels bolted on, say so. Better to fix it before submission than get rejected for it.
- **Don't write marketing copy.** Panelists review dozens of submissions. Direct, specific writing wins over hype.
