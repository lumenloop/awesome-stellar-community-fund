# SCF Project Reviewer

## Overview

Helps review SCF Build Award applications, producing concise, evidence-based assessments suitable for the SCF review form or standalone analysis.

## Review Process

1. **Gather context** — Search for the project, team, token, integration partner; check for prior launches on other chains; look up on-chain data; review the SCF handbook.
2. **Evaluate against SCF criteria** — Does Stellar play a core role? Is the team committed? Does the integration add lasting value? Is the budget appropriate?
3. **Produce review outputs** in the requested format (form fields, deep dive, or both).

## Evaluation Framework

Covers six areas:

| Area | What to Assess |
|------|---------------|
| **Integration Partner Fit** | Is the partner relevant? Is Stellar central to the integration? |
| **Technical Architecture** | Does the project use Soroban smart contracts? Is the design sound? |
| **Team Readiness** | Are team members named and credible? Prior Stellar/Soroban experience? |
| **Traction** | Organic demand signals, adoption metrics, existing user base? |
| **Budget & Deliverables** | Is the budget proportional to scope? Are milestones concrete? |
| **Ecosystem Commitment** | Long-term Stellar alignment or chain-hopping risk? |

## Output Formats

- **Form fields** — 1-2 bullet points per field, direct, no em dashes.
- **Deep-dive analysis** — Lead with what the project is, separate strengths from concerns, address ecosystem fit, end with a clear recommendation.

## Common Red Flags

- Max budget requested for a straightforward port
- Stellar positioned as a "secondary" chain
- No adoption targets or success metrics
- Prior inactive token launches on other chains
- pump.fun tokens
- No Soroban usage
- Unnamed or anonymous team members
- Peripheral integration partners with no clear Stellar relevance

## Common Strengths

- Organic demand from real users
- Real-world recurring use cases (payments, remittances, trade finance)
- Prior Stellar or Soroban experience
- Soroban smart contracts as a core component
- Concrete adoption metrics and milestones
- Proportional budgets that match deliverable scope
- Composable infrastructure that benefits the broader ecosystem
