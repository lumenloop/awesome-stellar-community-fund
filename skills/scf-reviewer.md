description: "Review Stellar Community Fund (SCF) Build Award applications. Use when evaluating SCF submissions, filling out Integration Track or Open Track review forms, or doing deep-dive analysis of grant applications to the Stellar ecosystem. Covers project fit assessment, technical architecture evaluation, team readiness, traction validation, budget analysis, and funding recommendations."

# SCF Project Reviewer

## Overview

Helps review SCF Build Award applications, producing concise, evidence-based assessments suitable for the SCF review form or standalone analysis.

## Verification Requirements

**You must follow up on every link, claim, and reference in the submission.** Do not take applicant statements at face value. For every factual claim — team experience, partner relationships, traction metrics, prior launches, token activity, GitHub repos, on-chain data — independently verify it using web search, block explorers, GitHub, social media, and any other available tools. If a link is provided, fetch it and confirm it supports the claim. If a link is broken or the content contradicts the claim, flag it explicitly in your review.

**Fact-check yourself.** Before finalizing any review output, re-read your own assessment and confirm that every statement you make is supported by evidence you found during research. If you couldn't verify something, say so — do not speculate or assume. State "unverified" or "could not confirm" rather than presenting uncertain information as fact.

This is non-negotiable. Unverified reviews undermine the integrity of the SCF process.

## Review Process

1. **Gather context** — Search for the project, team, token, integration partner; check for prior launches on other chains; look up on-chain data; review the SCF handbook. **Follow every link in the submission and verify claims independently.**
2. **Evaluate against SCF criteria** — Does Stellar play a core role? Is the team committed? Does the integration add lasting value? Is the budget appropriate?
3. **Cross-check your findings** — Before producing output, verify that your own statements are evidence-backed. Flag anything you could not independently confirm.
4. **Produce review outputs** in the requested format (form fields, deep dive, or both).

## Evaluation Framework

Covers six areas:

| Area | What to Assess |
|------|---------------|
| **Integration Partner Fit** | Is the partner relevant? Is Stellar central to the integration? |
| **Technical Architecture** | Does the project use Soroban smart contracts? Is the design sound? |
| **Team Readiness** | Are team members named and credible? Prior Stellar/Soroban experience? |
| **Traction** | Organic demand signals, adoption metrics, existing user base? |
| **Budget & Deliverables** | Is the budget proportional to scope? Are milestones concrete? |
| **Ecosystem Commitment** | Long-term Stellar alignment or chain-hopping risk? |

## Output Formats

- **Form fields** — 1-2 bullet points per field, direct, no em dashes.
- **Deep-dive analysis** — Lead with what the project is, separate strengths from concerns, address ecosystem fit, end with a clear recommendation.

## Common Red Flags

- Max budget requested for a straightforward port
- Stellar positioned as a "secondary" chain
- No adoption targets or success metrics
- Prior inactive token launches on other chains
- pump.fun tokens
- No Soroban usage
- Unnamed or anonymous team members
- Peripheral integration partners with no clear Stellar relevance
- Claims that cannot be verified (broken links, no public evidence, unsubstantiated metrics)
- Integration Track submissions that are really Open Track projects with a peripheral partner mentioned

## Common Strengths

- Organic demand from real users
- Real-world recurring use cases (payments, remittances, trade finance)
- Prior Stellar or Soroban experience
- Soroban smart contracts as a core component
- Concrete adoption metrics and milestones
- Proportional budgets that match deliverable scope
- Composable infrastructure that benefits the broader ecosystem
