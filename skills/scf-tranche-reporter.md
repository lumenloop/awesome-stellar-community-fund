# SCF Tranche Reporter

## Overview

Helps funded SCF Build Award teams write tranche submission reports that clearly demonstrate deliverable completion. Each tranche must be reviewed and approved before the next payment is released. A well-documented tranche submission speeds up review and avoids back-and-forth delays.

## When to Use

- A funded team has completed a tranche milestone and needs to submit deliverables for review
- A team wants to understand what tranche reviewers expect before they start building
- A team received feedback requesting more documentation on a previous tranche

## How Tranche Review Works

Build Awards are paid in four tranches:

| Tranche | % of Award | When Released |
|---|---|---|
| T0 | 10% | Paid automatically on award approval |
| T1 | 20% | After T1 deliverables are reviewed and approved |
| T2 | 30% | After T2 deliverables are reviewed and approved |
| T3 | 40% | After final deliverables including UX readiness are approved |

**Key facts:**
- Each tranche submission is reviewed by an SCF reviewer (often a Pilot or delegate)
- The reviewer checks whether each deliverable meets its stated completion criteria
- If deliverables are incomplete or evidence is insufficient, the team is asked to revise
- Delays in tranche approval are most commonly caused by insufficient documentation, not incomplete work
- The team's original application (with its deliverables and completion criteria) is the benchmark

## Process

### Step 1: Gather Deliverables

Pull the deliverables for this tranche from the original application. For each one, confirm:

1. **What was promised?** — Exact deliverable description and completion criteria from the application
2. **What was delivered?** — What the team actually built
3. **Any deviations?** — If the delivered work differs from what was proposed, explain why

### Step 2: Document Each Deliverable

For each deliverable, prepare:

#### Summary
One paragraph describing what was built and how it meets the completion criteria.

#### Evidence

Provide concrete, verifiable proof of completion. The type of evidence depends on the deliverable:

| Deliverable Type | Expected Evidence |
|---|---|
| Smart contract | Deployed contract address (testnet or mainnet), source code repo, passing test suite |
| API / Backend | API documentation, endpoint URLs, request/response examples, source code |
| Frontend / UI | Live URL or demo recording, screenshots of key flows, source code |
| SDK / Library | Published package (npm, crates.io, etc.), documentation, usage examples, source code |
| Documentation | Published docs URL, table of contents, completeness description |
| Integration | Working integration demo, partner confirmation if applicable, transaction evidence |
| Protocol / Infrastructure | Network deployment, performance benchmarks, architecture documentation |
| Research / Design | Published report, design files, findings summary |

**Evidence quality matters:**
- **Links must work.** Test every URL before submitting.
- **Code must be accessible.** Public repo or reviewer-accessible private repo. Include the specific commit hash or tag for the tranche.
- **Demos must be reproducible.** If it's a video, show the full flow. If it's a live URL, make sure it's stable.
- **On-chain evidence is strongest.** Contract addresses, transaction hashes, and block explorer links are unambiguous.

#### Completion Criteria Mapping

For each completion criterion from the original application, explicitly state how it was met:

```
**Completion Criterion:** "Soroban contract deployed on testnet with passing test suite"
**Status:** Met
**Evidence:** Contract deployed at [address] on Stellar Testnet. Test suite: 47 tests passing (see CI run [link]). Source code: [repo link, commit hash].
```

### Step 3: Address Deviations

If anything changed from the original plan:

- **Scope changes** — What changed and why. Was scope added, removed, or modified?
- **Timeline changes** — If delivery was later than estimated, briefly explain.
- **Approach changes** — If the technical approach changed, explain the reasoning.

Small deviations are normal and expected. Reviewers want transparency, not perfection. What causes problems is undisclosed changes or missing deliverables with no explanation.

### Step 4: Tranche-Specific Requirements

#### T0: Award Approval
- T0 (10%) is paid automatically when the award is approved — no deliverables to submit
- No tranche report is needed for T0

#### T1: Core Build
- This is the first tranche that requires a deliverable submission
- Must include a technical deliverable interacting with Stellar or Soroban
- Primary development work
- Show that the technical approach is viable and scaling

#### T2: Feature Complete
- All core functionality should be working
- Audit readiness (if applicable — LaunchKit audit credits unlock at T2)
- Integration testing complete
- This is where the project should be functionally complete, even if not yet production-ready

#### T3: Production Ready
- **UX readiness is mandatory** — Functional interfaces, usable onboarding, documentation for end users
- Mainnet deployment (if applicable)
- Comprehensive documentation
- Launch readiness — the project should be usable by its target audience
- Include adoption metrics or launch plan

### Step 5: Format the Report

Structure the tranche submission report clearly.

## Output Format

```
## Tranche [N] Submission: [Project Name]

**Award ID:** [SCF award identifier]
**Tranche:** T[N] ([percentage]%)
**Submission Date:** [Date]

---

### Deliverable 1: [Name]

**Description:** [What was promised]

**What was delivered:** [Brief summary of what was built]

**Completion Criteria:**

| Criterion | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| [Criterion from application] | Met | [Link/proof] |
| [Criterion from application] | Met | [Link/proof] |

**Links:**
- Source code: [repo URL, commit/tag]
- Deployment: [URL or contract address]
- Demo: [video or live URL]

---

### Deliverable 2: [Name]
[Same structure]

---

### Deviations from Original Plan
[If any — describe what changed and why. If none, state "No deviations from the original application."]

### Additional Notes
[Anything the reviewer should know — blockers resolved, lessons learned, plans for next tranche]

## Common Delays and How to Avoid Them

| Delay Cause | Prevention |
|---|---|
| Broken links in submission | Test every URL before submitting |
| Private repos without reviewer access | Make repos public or grant explicit access |
| Vague completion evidence ("see repo") | Point to specific files, commits, and test results |
| Missing deliverables with no explanation | Address every deliverable — even if incomplete, explain status |
| Demo not reproducible | Record a backup video; don't rely solely on live URLs |
| UX not ready at T3 | Plan UX work from T1, not as a T3 afterthought |
| Scope changes not disclosed | Document any changes proactively in the submission |

## What Not to Do

- **Don't submit incomplete tranches without explanation.** If a deliverable isn't done, say so and propose a plan.
- **Don't rely on "see the repo" as evidence.** Reviewers need specific pointers — files, commits, test results.
- **Don't skip T3 UX requirements.** Since SCF 7.0, UX readiness at T3 is mandatory.
- **Don't wait until the last minute.** Prepare documentation as you build, not after.
- **Don't change scope silently.** If plans changed, document it in the tranche report.
