## Available Skills

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [scf-reviewer](scf-reviewer.md) | Review SCF Build Award applications across Integration, Open, and RFP tracks. Covers project fit, technical architecture, team readiness, traction, budget analysis, and funding recommendations. |
| [scf-submission-drafter](scf-submission-drafter.md) | Draft Build Award applications interactively. Walks through project description, Stellar integration, architecture, team, deliverables, budget, and traction. |

| [scf-interest-form-drafter](scf-interest-form-drafter.md) | Draft a strong Interest Form — the first filter that determines whether a team gets invited to submit a full application. |
| [scf-tranche-reporter](scf-tranche-reporter.md) | Help funded teams write tranche submission reports with deliverable documentation, completion evidence, and the format reviewers expect. |
| [scf-competitor-analyst](scf-competitor-analyst.md) | Analyze the competitive landscape — similar projects on Stellar and other chains — and articulate differentiation for the application. |
| [scf-referral-preparer](scf-referral-preparer.md) | Prepare materials for an SCF referral. Covers what referrers evaluate and assembles a package that makes it easy for a Pilot or SDF staff member to endorse the team. |
