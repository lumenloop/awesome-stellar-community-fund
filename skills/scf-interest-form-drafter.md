# SCF Interest Form Drafter

## Overview

Helps teams write a strong Interest Form for the Stellar Community Fund. The Interest Form is the first filter — it determines whether a team gets invited to submit a full Build Award application. A weak Interest Form means the team never gets to apply, regardless of how good their project is.

## When to Use

- A team is preparing to submit an SCF Interest Form
- A team's Interest Form was previously not selected and they want to improve it
- A team wants to understand what the Interest Form evaluates before writing one

## What the Interest Form Is

The Interest Form is a short-form submission at [communityfund.stellar.org](https://communityfund.stellar.org) that provides a snapshot of:

- What the team is building
- Why it matters for the Stellar ecosystem
- Whether the team is credible and committed
- The project's current stage

Interest Forms are evaluated in batches. Strong submissions get invited to apply for a Build Award. The rest do not advance. There is no detailed rejection feedback at this stage.

**Important:** The Interest Form must be submitted before a referrer can fill out the referral form. The referral form asks referrers to select a project by name from the list of submitted Interest Forms.

## Process

### Step 1: Understand the Fields

The Interest Form is deliberately short. Each field matters. Help the team fill in:

#### Project Name
- Clear, descriptive, memorable
- Should immediately suggest what the project does
- Avoid generic names like "Stellar DeFi Platform" or "Blockchain Solution"

#### One-Line Description
This is the most important field. It must answer three questions in one sentence:
1. What are you building?
2. Who is it for?
3. Why does it need Stellar?

**Good examples:**
- "A Soroban-based lending protocol that lets Stellar asset holders earn yield without leaving the network"
- "Cross-border payroll tool using Stellar anchors to deliver USD-to-local-currency payments for remote workers in Latin America"
- "Open-source SDK for integrating Stellar wallet functionality into existing fintech apps with three lines of code"

**Bad examples:**
- "Revolutionary blockchain platform for the future of finance" — vague, no Stellar specificity
- "DeFi protocol" — tells the reviewer nothing
- "Building on Stellar" — not a description

#### Project Description
Expand on the one-liner. In 2–3 short paragraphs:

1. **The problem** — What specific pain point does this solve? For whom? Be concrete.
2. **The solution** — What are you building and how does it work? Name specific Stellar capabilities you use.
3. **Why now** — What makes this timely? New Stellar capability, market gap, ecosystem need?

**Keep it tight.** The Interest Form is not the full application. The goal is to demonstrate enough clarity and relevance that reviewers want to learn more.

#### Stellar Integration
Explain specifically how your project uses Stellar. Name the components:
- Soroban smart contracts (what they do)
- SEP implementations (which ones, why)
- Stellar asset issuance
- Anchor integrations
- Network features (finality, fees, throughput)

The test: could a reviewer read this section and understand exactly which parts of the Stellar stack you depend on?

#### Team
List key team members with:
- Name and role
- Relevant experience (1 sentence each)
- Link to profile (GitHub, LinkedIn, portfolio)

If the team has prior Stellar or Soroban experience, lead with that. If the team has delivered a prior SCF award, mention it prominently.

#### Current Stage
Be honest about where the project is:
- **Idea stage** — Weakest position. Describe what research or validation you've done.
- **Prototype/testnet** — Much stronger. Link to the deployment or demo.
- **Live/mainnet** — Strongest. Provide metrics and links.

Don't misrepresent your stage. If reviewers discover the project is earlier than claimed, it damages credibility for the full application.

#### Requested Budget Range
Provide a rough range, not an exact number. The Interest Form typically asks for a range:
- $25K–$50K
- $50K–$100K
- $100K–$150K

Choose the range that matches your scope. Remember: rejected submissions average higher budgets than funded ones. Don't inflate the range to "leave room" — right-size it.

### Step 2: Review and Sharpen

After drafting, check against these criteria:

- [ ] One-line description passes the clarity test (outsider can understand it)
- [ ] Stellar's role is specific and essential, not interchangeable
- [ ] Problem is concrete and audience is defined
- [ ] Team members are named with relevant experience
- [ ] Current stage is honest and supported by evidence
- [ ] Budget range matches scope complexity
- [ ] No jargon, buzzwords, or marketing language
- [ ] Every claim is accurate (don't overstate traction or team credentials)
- [ ] If applicable: Interest Form is submitted before asking a referrer to fill out the referral form

### Step 3: Optimize for Referral

If the team plans to get a referral:
- Submit the Interest Form first — referrers need to select the project by name from the system
- Make sure the project name and description are clear enough for the referrer to identify it
- Share the Interest Form content with the referrer so they have context when filling out their referral form

## Output Format

Produce a complete Interest Form draft with all fields filled in:

```
## Interest Form Draft: [Project Name]

**One-Line Description:** [Single sentence]

**Project Description:**
[2-3 paragraphs]

**Stellar Integration:**
[Specific Stellar capabilities used]

**Team:**
- [Name] — [Role] — [Experience] — [Link]
- [Name] — [Role] — [Experience] — [Link]

**Current Stage:** [Idea / Prototype / Testnet / Live]
[Supporting evidence]

**Requested Budget Range:** [$XK–$YK]

## What Not to Do

- **Don't write a whitepaper.** The Interest Form is a snapshot, not a full proposal. Be concise.
- **Don't be vague about Stellar.** "We'll use blockchain technology" is a fail. Name the specific Stellar features.
- **Don't oversell.** Reviewers are experienced. Claims without evidence hurt more than they help.
- **Don't skip the team section.** Anonymous or unnamed teams rarely advance past the Interest Form.
- **Don't submit without checking links.** If you include any URLs, test them.
