# SCF Competitor Analyst

## Overview

Helps SCF applicants research and articulate their competitive landscape. Identifies similar projects on Stellar and other chains, assesses overlap and differentiation, and produces a competitive positioning section that strengthens the application.

## Why This Matters

SCF reviewers evaluate whether a project fills a genuine ecosystem gap. If a similar project already exists on Stellar — especially one previously funded by the SCF — the applicant needs to explain why their project is different, better, or complementary. Ignoring competitors is a red flag. Addressing them directly builds credibility.

## When to Use

- A team is drafting an SCF application and needs to research similar projects
- A team wants to strengthen their differentiation section
- A reviewer wants to understand the competitive context for a submission they're evaluating
- A team is unsure whether their idea overlaps with existing SCF-funded projects

## Process

### Step 1: Define the Project's Category

Identify what the project is, specifically enough to search for competitors:

- **Category** — DeFi (lending, DEX, yield), payments, wallet, identity, data/oracle, infrastructure, developer tooling, NFT/gaming, social, compliance/KYC
- **Core function** — What specific thing does it do? (e.g., "Soroban-based lending protocol" not "DeFi platform")
- **Target user** — Who uses it? (developers, end users, businesses, specific geographies)
- **Stellar integration** — What part of the Stellar stack does it use?

### Step 2: Search Stellar Ecosystem

Research existing projects in the same space:

#### SCF-Funded Projects
- Search the [SCF Awards Page](https://communityfund.stellar.org/awards) for previously funded projects in the same category
- Check whether those projects are still active, delivered, or abandoned
- Note their scope, budget, and what they built

#### Active Stellar Projects
- Search the Stellar ecosystem for live projects doing similar things
- Check Stellar Expert, Stellar ecosystem directories, and the Stellar Developer Discord
- Look for projects that launched without SCF funding as well

#### Key Questions
For each competitor found:
- Is it still active? When was the last commit, update, or transaction?
- What did it build? How mature is it?
- Was it SCF-funded? If so, did it deliver all tranches?
- What's its user base or traction?
- What's the overlap with the applicant's project?
- What's the gap — what does the applicant's project do that this one doesn't?

### Step 3: Search Broader Ecosystem

Look beyond Stellar for relevant competitors:

#### Other Chains
- Ethereum/EVM equivalents (Aave, Uniswap, etc. for DeFi; similar projects on Solana, Cosmos, etc.)
- Are any of these expanding to Stellar?
- Has the applicant's team built the same thing on another chain?

#### Traditional / Web2 Competitors
- If the project serves end users, who are the non-crypto alternatives?
- What advantages does the Stellar-based approach offer?

### Step 4: Build the Competitive Analysis

Organize findings into a structured comparison:

#### Competitive Landscape Table

```
### Competitive Landscape

| Project | Chain | Status | Overlap | Key Difference |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [Competitor 1] | Stellar | Active / Inactive | [What overlaps] | [What's different] |
| [Competitor 2] | Stellar (SCF-funded) | Delivered / Abandoned | [What overlaps] | [What's different] |
| [Competitor 3] | Ethereum | Active | [What overlaps] | [What's different] |
| [Web2 Alternative] | N/A | Active | [What overlaps] | [What's different] |
```

#### Differentiation Summary

After the table, write a clear differentiation narrative:

1. **What gap does this project fill?** — Not "we're better" but "this specific capability doesn't exist on Stellar today"
2. **Why isn't an existing project sufficient?** — If a similar SCF-funded project exists, explain why a new one is needed (different approach, different audience, abandoned project, complementary scope)
3. **What's the unfair advantage?** — Team expertise, existing user base, unique technical approach, geographic focus, partnership access
4. **How does this compose with existing projects?** — The strongest answer isn't "we replace X" but "we complement X by doing Y"

### Step 5: Assess Risk

Flag potential concerns a reviewer might raise:

- **Duplicate funding risk** — Would the SCF be funding the same thing twice?
- **Abandoned predecessor** — If a similar SCF-funded project failed, why will this one succeed?
- **Chain-hopping risk** — If the team has the same product on other chains, is Stellar a genuine commitment or a grant opportunity?
- **Market saturation** — Are there already enough projects in this category on Stellar?

For each risk, help the team prepare a direct, honest response.

## Output Format

```
## Competitive Analysis: [Project Name]

### Category
[Category] — [Core function] — [Target user]

### Stellar Ecosystem
[Summary of similar projects on Stellar]

| Project | Status | SCF-Funded | Overlap | Gap |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

### Broader Landscape
[Summary of similar projects on other chains and Web2]

| Project | Chain/Type | Overlap | Applicant's Advantage |
|---|---|---|---|
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

### Differentiation
[2-3 paragraphs articulating why this project is needed despite existing alternatives]

### Reviewer Concerns to Address
- [Concern 1]: [Suggested response]
- [Concern 2]: [Suggested response]

### Recommended Positioning
[1-2 sentences the team can use in their application to frame their competitive position]
```

## What Not to Do

- **Don't ignore competitors.** Claiming "there's nothing like this" when similar projects exist is a red flag.
- **Don't trash competitors.** "Project X is terrible" is unprofessional. "Project X serves a different audience" or "Project X focused on Y while we focus on Z" is constructive.
- **Don't hide overlap.** Reviewers will find similar projects. It's better to address overlap directly than to have a reviewer discover it and question your credibility.
- **Don't fabricate advantages.** If the differentiation is thin, acknowledge it and focus on what's genuinely different — even if it's execution quality, geographic focus, or user experience.
- **Don't only compare to other chains.** The most relevant competitors are on Stellar itself, especially SCF-funded ones.
