# Post-Launch and Growth

> SCF 7.0 doesn't end at mainnet launch. Teams that ship and demonstrate traction unlock post-launch support including Growth Hack funding, BD support, liquidity grants, public good funding, and investment access. This guide covers how to qualify, how to prepare, and how to set yourself up for growth from day one.

## What's Available After Launch

SCF 7.0 offers several post-launch programs for teams that complete all four tranches and demonstrate real usage:

| Program | What You Get |
|---------|-------------|
| **Growth Hack** | Targeted funding and support for user acquisition experiments and repeatable growth loops |
| **Liquidity Grants** | Funding to bootstrap liquidity for DeFi protocols and trading pairs on Stellar |
| **Public Good Funding** | Support for open-source infrastructure, public goods, and ecosystem-wide tooling |
| **BD and go-to-market support** | Strategic introductions and go-to-market sprint assistance from SDF |
| **Agency, distribution, and investment access** | Introductions to marketing partners, ecosystem distribution channels, and investor networks |
| **Additional Build Awards** | Teams with significant traction can apply for subsequent awards (up to $300K lifetime) |

### The Qualification Bar

Only projects with **live mainnet deployments and verifiable on-chain usage** qualify. This means:

- Your product must be deployed on Stellar mainnet (not just testnet)
- You must have completed all four tranches of your Build Award
- You must show real, organic on-chain activity (not manufactured or bot-driven)
- Usage must be verifiable — reviewers will check block explorers and your public metrics

## Setting Up for Growth from Day One

The teams that unlock post-launch support are the ones that plan for growth during their Build Award, not after it. Here's how to build growth into your project from the start.

### 1. Instrument Metrics Early

Don't wait until mainnet to start tracking. Set up measurement infrastructure during T1 or T2.

**On-chain metrics to track:**
- Transaction count and volume (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Unique active wallets
- Contract invocations
- TVL (for DeFi projects)
- Asset holders and trustline count

**Off-chain metrics to track:**
- Monthly active users (MAU)
- Retention cohorts (day 1, day 7, day 30)
- Conversion funnel (visit -> signup -> first action)
- Session frequency and duration
- Error rates and user drop-off points

**Tools:**
- On-chain: Stellar block explorers, custom indexers, Mercury, Hubble
- Off-chain: PostHog, Mixpanel, Google Analytics, Amplitude
- Dashboards: Build a public dashboard early — it demonstrates transparency and makes your traction verifiable

### 2. Define Your Growth Model

Before you launch, answer: **How will users find your product, and why will they come back?**

Common growth models for Stellar projects:

| Model | How It Works | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Viral / referral** | Existing users invite new users through product mechanics | Payments app with send-to-anyone links |
| **Content / SEO** | Users find you through search or educational content | DeFi protocol with tutorials ranking for Stellar DeFi queries |
| **Partnership / distribution** | Partners drive users to your product | Wallet integrated into existing fintech app's menu |
| **Community / ecosystem** | Stellar community adoption and word-of-mouth | Developer tool promoted through Discord and Stellar Dev Docs |
| **Direct sales / BD** | You sell to businesses or institutions directly | B2B anchor service with direct enterprise outreach |

Pick the model that fits your product. You don't need all of them — you need one that works and can be repeated.

### 3. Plan User Acquisition Experiments

Growth Hack funding supports experiments. Come prepared with hypotheses you want to test.

**Example experiments:**
- "If we add referral rewards (0.5% of referred user's first transaction), we expect 20% of users to refer at least one person within 30 days."
- "If we create a Stellar-specific onboarding tutorial and promote it in the Stellar Discord, we expect 200 new users within 2 weeks."
- "If we integrate with [Wallet Partner]'s discovery page, we expect 500 new users per month from that channel."

Each experiment should have:
- A hypothesis
- A metric to measure
- A timeline
- A cost estimate
- A success threshold

### 4. Build Referral and Sharing Mechanics Into the Product

Don't bolt referrals on later. Design them into your core flows:

- Shareable transaction links or receipts
- Referral codes or invite flows
- Social sharing of achievements or milestones
- Public profiles or leaderboards (if appropriate)

### 5. Engage the Stellar Community

The Stellar community is your first distribution channel. Build relationships during your Build Award so you have an audience at launch:

- Share progress updates in the Stellar Developer Discord (#scf-general, #build)
- Write devlog posts about what you're learning building on Soroban
- Contribute to ecosystem discussions — help other builders, answer questions
- Participate in community calls and AMAs

## Additional Build Awards

Teams that complete all tranches and demonstrate significant traction can apply for subsequent Build Awards. The lifetime cap is $150K standard, with up to $300K available case-by-case for high-traction projects.

To strengthen a second application:
- Show clear on-chain growth metrics from your first award
- Explain what the additional funding enables that you couldn't do with the first award
- Present concrete growth data, not just promises
- Demonstrate that the first award was used efficiently and all deliverables were met

## Timeline: Growth Planning Across Tranches

| Tranche | Growth Actions |
|---------|---------------|
| **T0** | Define growth model, identify target metrics, research distribution channels |
| **T1** | Set up analytics infrastructure, instrument core flows, build referral mechanics |
| **T2** | Launch testnet to community, collect feedback, start building audience, create public dashboard |
| **T3** | Launch on mainnet with onboarding flow, begin user acquisition, track metrics |
| **Post-launch** | Apply for Growth Hack, run experiments, explore liquidity grants or public good funding, pursue additional Build Award if needed |
