# Interest Form Tips

> The SCF Interest Form is the first filter. Every new project starts here before being invited to submit a full Build Award application. This guide covers how to write a strong Interest Form that gets you past the gate.

## What the Interest Form Is

In SCF 7.0, you no longer submit directly to a Build Award round. Instead, you start with an Interest Form at [communityfund.stellar.org](https://communityfund.stellar.org). A panel reviews your submission for potential value, eligibility, and team capability. If you pass, you're invited to submit a full Build Award application in an upcoming round.

The Interest Form is not a formality. It's a filter. Weak Interest Forms don't get invitations, and without an invitation, you don't get to apply.

## What Reviewers Evaluate

The panel assessing Interest Forms looks for three things:

1. **Potential value to the Stellar ecosystem** — Does this project address a real need? Would it create lasting value?
2. **Eligibility** — Is the team eligible? Is Stellar core to the project? Is this the right funding mechanism?
3. **Team capability** — Can this team realistically build what they're proposing?

You don't need a complete technical spec or detailed budget at this stage. You need to convince the panel that your idea is worth a closer look.

## How to Write a Strong Interest Form

### Lead with the Problem

State the specific problem you're solving in 1-2 sentences. Don't start with your solution or your team. Start with why this matters.

**Weak:** "We're building a DeFi platform on Soroban."
**Strong:** "Cross-border freelancers in Southeast Asia lose 5-8% of their income to remittance fees. We're building a Stellar-based payment rail that reduces that to under 1%."

### Explain Why Stellar

In 2-3 sentences, explain why Stellar (and/or Soroban) is the right infrastructure for your solution. This is where reviewers check for shoehorning. If you could swap Stellar for any other chain and your project would be identical, your answer here is too weak.

**Weak:** "Stellar is fast and cheap."
**Strong:** "We use Stellar's anchor network (SEP-31) to connect to local payment rails in the Philippines and Mexico. Stellar's existing regulated anchor infrastructure is something we'd have to build from scratch on other chains."

### Name Your Team

List your core team members by name and relevant experience. Anonymous or unnamed teams are a red flag even at the Interest Form stage.

Include:
- Names (at least first name + last initial)
- Roles
- Relevant experience (especially Stellar/Soroban, blockchain, or domain expertise)
- Links to LinkedIn, GitHub, or prior work (if available)

### State Your Track

Tell the panel which track you're targeting (Integration, Open, or RFP) and why. This helps them route your submission correctly and signals that you understand the SCF structure.

For Integration Track: name your integration partner and the building block.
For RFP Track: reference the specific RFP you're responding to.
For Open Track: explain why your project doesn't fit Integration or RFP.

### Show Any Traction (If You Have It)

If you have existing users, a prototype, a waitlist, or partner commitments, mention them briefly. This is not required at the Interest Form stage, but it significantly strengthens your submission.

Even early signals help: "We've interviewed 30 freelancers who currently use [competitor] and confirmed they'd switch for lower fees."

## Interest Form vs Build Award Application

The Interest Form is a pitch, not a full proposal. Keep it concise.

| | Interest Form | Build Award |
|---|---|---|
| **Length** | Short (a few paragraphs) | Full submission with all sections |
| **Technical detail** | High-level approach | Detailed architecture, contracts, data flows |
| **Budget** | Rough estimate or range | Bottom-up line-item budget |
| **Deliverables** | General milestone outline | Specific per-tranche deliverables |
| **Traction** | Brief mention if available | Detailed metrics and evidence |
| **Purpose** | Get invited to apply | Get funded |

Don't write your Build Award application in the Interest Form. Be concise, be clear, and save the depth for the full submission.

## The Referral Advantage

If you can get a referral from a Pilot or SDF staff member, do it before submitting your Interest Form. Referred teams receive:

- Stronger trust signals during review
- Faster time-to-decision
- Bypass of AI-based prescreening

Teams without referrals go through standard processing, which includes AI prescreening that filters low-signal submissions. A referral doesn't guarantee an invitation, but it significantly improves your odds and speed.

**How to get a referral:**
- Join the Stellar Developer Discord and engage in #scf-general
- Attend Stellar ecosystem events and meetups
- Build relationships with Pilots and SDF staff who are active in the ecosystem

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Hurts |
|---------|-------------|
| Writing a novel | The Interest Form should be concise. Save detail for the Build Award. |
| No clear problem statement | Reviewers can't assess value if they don't understand the problem. |
| "We'll use Stellar because it's fast" | Doesn't show genuine understanding. Explain the specific Stellar capabilities you need. |
| Anonymous team | Unnamed teams are flagged at every stage. Name your people. |
| Wrong track selection | Applying to Integration Track for a novel protocol wastes everyone's time. |
| No mention of why now | Why is this the right time? What's changed? Urgency and timing matter. |
| Copy-pasting a generic pitch | Reviewers can tell when a submission wasn't written for SCF. Tailor it. |
