# Getting a Referral for the Stellar Community Fund

> How the SCF Referral Program works, what referrers actually evaluate, and how to approach a referral the right way — without burning a relationship.

## Why Referrals Matter

SCF 7.0 introduced a verified referral pathway as a core part of how strong teams get surfaced. Referrals are not required to apply — anyone can submit at any time — but they create real advantages:

- **Stronger trust signals.** Your application carries weight from someone the SCF already trusts.
- **Faster time-to-decision.** Referred submissions are prioritized in the review pipeline.
- **Human context.** Your referrer adds qualitative insight about your team that no form can capture.

Without a referral, your submission goes through AI-powered prescreening that filters low-signal applications before human reviewers see them. That filter works, but a referral bypasses it entirely.

The referral program exists to build a more trust-based sourcing layer for the SCF — helping discover strong teams earlier, adding real-world context to applications, and expanding into new geographies and communities.

## How the Referral Program Works

### Who Can Refer

Referrers are trusted ecosystem contributors who have been vetted and invited into the program. They typically include:

- **SCF Pilots** — The core group of experienced community members who serve as delegates, reviewers, and governance participants across SCF rounds. Pilots are the most common referrers.
- **Stellar Development Foundation staff** — SDF team members who work directly with the ecosystem and have visibility into what the network needs.
- **Stellar Ambassadors** — Regional community leaders recognized by the ecosystem.
- **SCF alumni** — Teams who have previously received and delivered on SCF awards.
- **Accelerator programs and official ecosystem partners** — Organizations with established Stellar relationships.

Each referrer receives a **unique referrer code** that they use when endorsing teams. This code ties every referral back to the referrer's track record.

### What Referrers Stake

Referrals are not free endorsements. Referrers earn **recognition and financial incentives tied to the success of teams they refer.** This creates skin-in-the-game:

- If the teams a referrer endorses get funded and deliver, the referrer builds reputation and earns incentives.
- If a referrer endorses weak teams that fail or waste funding, their credibility erodes.

This is why referrers are selective. Their reputation is on the line with every endorsement.

### What a Referral Does Not Do

- **A referral does not guarantee funding.** It strengthens your application but does not bypass SCF governance.
- **A referral does not replace your submission.** You still need to submit the Interest Form, get invited to a Build Award round, and write a complete, strong application.
- **A referral does not mean the referrer is your advocate during review.** It means they surfaced you as a credible team. Your submission has to stand on its own after that.

## What the Referrer Evaluates

When a referrer fills out the SCF Project Referral Form for your team, they answer detailed questions across four areas. Understanding what they're asked to assess tells you exactly what you need to demonstrate before requesting a referral.

### 1. How They Know You

The referrer describes how they met or discovered your team. This establishes the basis for their assessment — is it a deep working relationship, a conference introduction, or a cold DM? Deeper context carries more weight.

### 2. Team Assessment

The referrer evaluates:

- **What makes this team a strong candidate for SCF?** — They need to articulate why you stand out.
- **What indicators suggest this team can execute?** — Technical track record, operational history, market experience. They need concrete evidence, not vibes.
- **Anything else that makes the team stand out?** — Unique strengths, domain expertise, community standing.

### 3. Stellar Build Readiness

The referrer assesses:

- **Has the team started building on Stellar / built on Stellar before?** — Prior Stellar work is the strongest signal.
- **If not, how committed is the team to Stellar?** — They need to gauge whether you'll actually build here or chase the next grant elsewhere.
- **What's the project's current stage? Do they have existing traction?** — Referrers are asked to assess where you actually are, not where you say you'll be.

### 4. Conflict of Interest

The referrer must disclose any financial interest, advisory role, or formal relationship with your team. They certify the referral is made in good faith with no kickbacks or improper incentives.

## How to Approach a Referral the Right Way

This is the most important section in this guide. A referral request is a trust transaction. The referrer is putting their reputation on the line for you. If you waste that, you don't just hurt your own chances — you damage their standing in the program and make them less likely to help anyone in the future.

### Before You Ask: The Readiness Checklist

Do not ask for a referral until you can honestly check every box:

- [ ] **You can clearly explain what you're building, for whom, and why it needs Stellar.** If you can't articulate this in 2–3 sentences, you're not ready.
- [ ] **You have something to show.** Code, a prototype, a deployed contract, a demo — some tangible proof that you're building, not just planning.
- [ ] **You've done your homework on the SCF.** You understand the tracks, the tranche structure, and what reviewers look for. You've read the guides.
- [ ] **Your team is real and credible.** Named people with relevant experience, public profiles, and a track record of shipping.
- [ ] **You have evidence of demand.** Users, waitlist signups, partner commitments, or at minimum a clear articulation of validated need.
- [ ] **You've already submitted (or are ready to submit) the Interest Form.** The referrer's form asks them to select your project by name from the Interest Form list. If you haven't submitted one, they can't refer you.

### How to Ask

**Do:**

- **Build a relationship first.** Engage authentically in the Stellar Developer Discord, attend events, contribute to ecosystem conversations. The best referrals come from people who know your work, not people you cold-messaged.
- **Be specific about your project.** When you approach a potential referrer, give them enough context to evaluate you: what you're building, your technical approach, your team, your progress, and why you're applying to the SCF.
- **Make it easy for them to assess you.** Share your GitHub repo, a demo, your Interest Form draft, or a brief project summary. The referrer needs to fill out a detailed form about your team — give them the material to do it well.
- **Respect their decision.** If someone says no or doesn't respond, accept it. They may not think your project is ready, or they may have limited referral capacity. Either way, pushing harder only damages the relationship.
- **Ask early enough.** Don't ask for a referral the day before the submission deadline. Referrers need time to evaluate your project and fill out the form thoughtfully.

**Don't:**

- **Don't cold-DM referrers asking for codes.** This is the fastest way to get ignored. Referrers receive a lot of these, and unsolicited requests from unknown teams signal that you're optimizing for shortcuts rather than building something real.
- **Don't misrepresent your progress.** If the referrer vouches for capabilities you don't have, it reflects badly on both of you when the application is reviewed.
- **Don't treat the referral as a guaranteed pass.** It's a trust signal, not a ticket. Your application still needs to be strong.
- **Don't ask multiple referrers simultaneously.** This looks like you're shopping for endorsements rather than seeking a genuine assessment.
- **Don't offer the referrer anything in exchange.** The referral form includes a conflict of interest disclosure. Any quid pro quo arrangement violates the program's terms and conditions.

## The Process, Step by Step

Here's the full flow from the applicant's perspective:

```
1. Build your project and prepare your application
   |
2. Submit the Interest Form at communityfund.stellar.org
   |
3. Build a relationship with a potential referrer
   (SCF alumni, ambassador, accelerator, ecosystem partner)
   |
4. Share your project details and ask if they'd be willing to refer you
   |
5. If yes: the referrer submits the SCF Project Referral Form
   using their unique referrer code, selecting your project by name
   |
6. Your Interest Form is reviewed with the referral signal attached
   |
7. If invited: submit your full Build Award application
   (the referral context carries through to panel review)
```

**Important:** The Interest Form must be submitted before the referrer can fill out the referral form. The referral form asks the referrer to select your project from a list of submitted Interest Forms. If your project isn't in the system, they can't refer you.

## What If You Don't Have a Referral?

Referrals are valuable but not required. Plenty of projects get funded without one.

Without a referral, your submission goes through **AI-powered prescreening** — an automated filter that evaluates whether your application meets basic quality and relevance thresholds before human reviewers see it. To pass prescreening:

- Make sure your submission is complete and coherent
- Demonstrate that Stellar is core to your project
- Include technical specifics, not just a concept
- Provide a realistic, justified budget
- Show your team's credibility

18.7% of Build Award submissions fail at prescreen. The most common causes are incomplete applications, missing Stellar integration, and vague or ineligible proposals. A strong submission passes prescreening without a referral — the referral just gives you a head start.

## Where to Find Potential Referrers

The SCF doesn't publish a public list of referrers. But referrers are typically drawn from two main groups:

- **SCF Pilots.** The most common referrers. Pilots are the highest governance tier in the SCF community — they serve as quarterly delegates on review panels, participate in Pilot-only strategy conversations, and can propose and vote on governance decisions. They're visible in the Stellar Developer Discord, active in round reviews, and deeply familiar with what makes a strong submission. If you're engaged in the ecosystem, you'll encounter Pilots naturally.
- **SDF staff.** Stellar Development Foundation team members who work directly with ecosystem projects. They have visibility into strategic priorities and what the network needs. SDF employees can refer teams but do not receive financial referral incentives.

Other potential referrers include:

- **Stellar Ambassadors.** Regional community leaders active in local Stellar communities.
- **SCF alumni with completed awards.** Teams that have delivered all tranches. Check the [SCF Awards page](https://communityfund.stellar.org/awards) for previously funded projects.
- **Accelerator programs and ecosystem partners.** Organizations with established Stellar relationships.

The best path to finding a referrer is being visibly active in the ecosystem before you need one. Pilots and SDF staff notice teams that contribute authentically — not teams that appear only when they want something.

## Key Takeaway

A referral is earned, not requested. It's the natural result of building something real, being present in the ecosystem, and demonstrating that your team is worth vouching for. If you focus on those things, the referral conversation becomes easy. If you skip them, no amount of outreach will make up the difference.
