## SCF 1.0 — Community Voting (Rounds 1–5)

**Period:** April 2019 – 2020
**Rounds:** SCF #1 through SCF #5
**Award type in DB:** `Legacy v1.0 Award`

### What It Was

The SCF launched on April 17, 2019, replacing the centralized Stellar Build Challenge with an open, community-driven funding model. Any community member could nominate projects, and the community voted on which ones to fund. The Stellar Development Foundation distributed **12 million XLM per year** across quarterly rounds.

Awards were denominated in XLM rather than USD, so the dollar value fluctuated with market price.

### By the Numbers

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Submissions in DB | 41 awarded |
| Total submissions (incl. not awarded) | 142 |
| Approval rate | 28.9% |
| Budget range | $14,101 – $56,320 |
| Median budget | $38,388 |
| Average budget | $33,284 |
| Total paid out | $1,189,836 |

### Top Categories

Applications dominated (23 of 41 awards), followed by Infrastructure & Services (9) and Developer Tooling (6).

### Notable Projects

- Stellarmint ($51K)
- Lettuce: Stellar-based point of sale ($49K)
- Stellar Update — Dedicated Blog ($56K)
- Free Voting Platform ($38K)

## SCF 2.0 — Lab Fund and Seed Fund (Rounds 6–7)

**Period:** 2020–2021
**Rounds:** SCF #6 and SCF #7
**Award type in DB:** `Legacy v2.0 Award`

### What Changed

SCF 2.0 split funding into two tiers:

- **Lab Fund** — Smaller, experimental projects. Lower amounts, faster turnaround.
- **Seed Fund** — Scaling companies with larger asks. Panel-driven selection alongside community voting.

This was the first time the SCF introduced structured panel review alongside community votes. Award amounts increased significantly compared to v1.0.

### By the Numbers

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Submissions in DB | 16 awarded |
| Total submissions | 80 |
| Approval rate | 20.0% |
| Budget range | $653 – $354,506 |
| Median budget | $131,974 |
| Average budget | $136,336 |
| Total paid out | $2,181,373 |

### Notable Projects

- COINQVEST — Enterprise Payment Processing ($355K)
- Anclap — Anchor + Debit Card ($326K)
- OptionBlox & YieldBlox — DeFi Protocols ($321K)

The v2.0 era saw the largest individual awards in SCF history, with several projects receiving $250K+.

---

## SCF 3.0 — Iterative Feedback (Rounds 8–11)

**Period:** 2021–2022
**Rounds:** SCF #8 through SCF #11
**Award type in DB:** `Legacy v3.0 Award`

### What Changed

SCF 3.0 introduced several structural improvements:

- **USD-denominated budgets** — Projects now specified their budget request in USD rather than XLM, reducing exchange rate uncertainty.
- **Selection panel** — Projects had to pass a panel review before moving to community vote.
- **Iterative feedback** — Community feedback loops were built into the process, allowing projects to improve submissions between rounds.
- **Awards up to $100K** — Though some outliers existed from earlier commitments.

### By the Numbers

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Submissions in DB | 57 awarded |
| Total submissions | 450 |
| Approval rate | 12.7% |
| Budget range | $2,500 – $236,763 |
| Median budget | $50,000 |
| Average budget | $70,142 |
| Total paid out | $4,070,920 |

The approval rate dropped sharply (12.7%) as the number of submissions grew while standards tightened.

### Top Categories

Applications led again (37 awards), followed by Developer Tooling (10).

### Notable Projects

- OrunPay ($237K)
- Stellar PHP SDK ($225K)
- Beans App ($220K)

## SCF 4.0 — The Soroban Era (Rounds 12–19)

**Period:** 2022–2023
**Rounds:** SCF #12 through SCF #19
**Award type in DB:** `Legacy v4.0 Award`

### What Changed

SCF 4.0 coincided with the launch of Soroban (Stellar's smart contract platform), which transformed the types of projects being funded:

- **Proof of Intent** — Every eligible project accepted by the selection panel received **10% of their requested budget** upfront as proof of intent. The remaining 90% was released after community vote.
- **Awards up to $150K** — The cap was raised to accommodate more ambitious Soroban projects.
- **Rapid round cadence** — Rounds ran more frequently (roughly every 6 weeks), increasing the total volume of funded projects significantly.
- **Soroban-native projects** — DeFi protocols, smart contract tooling, and on-chain applications became common submission types for the first time.

### By the Numbers

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Submissions in DB | 108–110 awarded |
| Total submissions | 464 |
| Approval rate | 23.7% |
| Budget range | $1,000 – $150,000 |
| Median budget | $88,750 |
| Average budget | $87,188 |
| Total paid out | $9,355,078 |

### Top Categories

A more balanced distribution emerged as Soroban opened new categories:
- Applications: 31
- Developer Tooling: 28
- Infrastructure & Services: 22
- Financial Protocols: 19
- Education & Community: 7

### Notable Projects

- Stellar/Soroban Public RPC Infrastructure — Gateway.fm ($150K)
- Decaf Pay ($150K)
- Phoenix DeFi Hub ($150K)
- HiYield ($150K)
- Comet ($150K)

## SCF 5.0 — Activation + Community Awards (Rounds 20–29)

**Period:** 2023–2024
**Rounds:** SCF #20 through SCF #29
**Award types in DB:** `Legacy v5.0 Activation Award` and `Legacy v5.0 Community Award`

### What Changed

SCF 5.0 was a major governance overhaul:

- **Dual-award model** — Two separate award types replaced the single award:
  - **Activation Award** — For first-time or early-stage teams. Selected by a panel. Smaller budgets (up to $96K, median $40K). Designed to prove the team can execute on Stellar.
  - **Community Award** — For established projects with traction. Decided by community vote. Larger budgets (up to $100K, median $85K).
- **Neural Quorum Governance** — A reputation-based voting mechanism developed with BlockScience, modeled after neural networks with layered voting neurons. Launched October 2023. Voters build reputation through participation, and can delegate votes.
- **SCF Verified membership** — Participants needed to become SCF Verified to gain voting rights.
- **Massive scale-up** — With almost $10M allocated to 130+ projects in 2023 alone, SCF quintupled its funding compared to previous years.

### Activation Award — By the Numbers

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Submissions in DB | 212 awarded |
| Total submissions | 782 |
| Approval rate | 27.1% |
| Budget range | $5,000 – $96,000 |
| Median budget | $40,000 |
| Total paid out | $8,117,911 |

### Community Award — By the Numbers

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Submissions in DB | 105–109 awarded |
| Total submissions | 192 |
| Approval rate | 56.8% |
| Budget range | $2,500 – $100,000 |
| Median budget | $85,000 |
| Total paid out | $8,123,916 |

The Community Award had a much higher approval rate (56.8%) because projects reaching community vote had already been vetted and typically had existing traction.

### Top Categories (Combined)

- Applications: 111
- Developer Tooling: 98
- Financial Protocols: 49
- Infrastructure & Services: 37
- Education & Community: 25

### Notable Projects

**Activation Awards:** Planet Pay ($96K), Almanax ($50K), AnChain.AI Web3SOC ($50K), Blade: TradFi to DeFi Bridge ($50K)

**Community Awards:** BondHive ($100K), Stellar Prepaid Cards in Peru ($100K), Bitwave Enterprise Payments ($100K), Allbridge Core II ($100K), Beans App — Cards & passkeys ($100K)

---

## SCF 6.0 — Unified Build Award (Rounds 30–40)

**Period:** September 2024 – January 2026
**Rounds:** SCF #30 through SCF #40
**Award type in DB:** `Build`

### What Changed

SCF 6.0, launched on September 4, 2024, simplified the award structure:

- **Single Build Award** — The Activation and Community Awards were merged into one unified Build Award, with **up to $150,000 in XLM** per project.
- **Category Delegate Panels** — Quarterly-rotating panels of domain experts replaced the previous selection process. Delegates were nominated from the community.
- **Kickstart program** — A 5-day virtual bootcamp (evolved from Startup Camp) for early-stage teams. Up to $15K per project. Designed to feed the Build Award pipeline.
- **Stellar LaunchKit** — Unlocked at the Testnet milestone (T2), providing audit credits, UX audits, infrastructure offers, and accelerator connections.
- **Milestone-based tranches** — Funding distributed as MVP → Testnet → Mainnet milestones, with the 10% Proof of Intent continuing from v4.0.
- **Lifetime cap** — Up to $150K per team, with case-by-case exceptions up to $300K for high-traction projects.

### By the Numbers

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Submissions in DB | 212 awarded |
| Total submissions | 1,048 |
| Approval rate | 20.2% |
| Prescreen failures | 196 (18.7% of all submissions) |
| Budget range | $10,000 – $150,000 |
| Median budget | $93,700 |
| Average budget | $93,242 |
| Total paid out | $14,621,958 |

### Budget Distribution

| Range | Funded Projects |
|---|---|
| $10K – $25K | 5 |
| $25K – $50K | 28 |
| $50K – $75K | 39 |
| $75K – $100K | 48 |
| $100K – $125K | 39 |
| $125K – $150K | 56 |

### Top Categories

- Applications: 100
- Infrastructure & Services: 40
- Financial Protocols: 39
- Developer Tooling: 33

### Notable Patterns

- Applications were the dominant category for the first time at nearly half of all funded projects.
- The median budget ($93.7K) was the highest of any SCF version, reflecting larger-scope projects.
- Prescreen failures emerged as a new filter — 18.7% of submissions were rejected before reaching review, highlighting the importance of submission quality.

## SCF 7.0 — Three Specialized Tracks (Round 41+)

**Period:** January 2026 – present
**Rounds:** SCF #41+
**Award types:** Build Award (Integration Track, Open Track, RFP Track) + Instawards

### What Changed

SCF 7.0, announced January 16, 2026, is the most structural redesign since v5.0:

- **Three Build Award tracks:**
  - **Integration Track** — For teams building end-user applications that integrate an existing Stellar building block (DeFi protocol, wallet SDK, anchor service). Reviewed by rotating delegate panel. Eligible building blocks decided by community vote each quarter.
  - **Open Track** — For experienced teams building novel protocols or infrastructure. Decided by community vote via Neural Quorum Governance.
  - **RFP Track** — For developers responding to published Requests for Proposals targeting identified developer tooling and infrastructure gaps. Reviewed by domain-expert delegate panels.
- **Instawards** — Replaced Kickstart. Decentralized, ambassador-led awards of up to $15K for very early-stage teams. Regional Stellar Ambassador chapters recommend projects, subject to SDF approval.
- **Referral system** — Trusted ecosystem participants (Pilots and SDF staff) can refer teams. Referred submissions get stronger trust signals and faster review. Referrers earn recognition and financial incentives.
- **AI-powered prescreening** — Non-referred submissions go through automated prescreening to filter low-signal applications.
- **UX readiness gate** — The final tranche (T3) now requires functional interfaces and usable onboarding, not just a mainnet deployment.
- **Interest Form first** — All new projects submit an Interest Form before being invited to a Build Award round.
- **Post-launch support** — Growth Hack program, liquidity grants, public good funding, BD support, and investment access for teams with live mainnet deployments.
- **Four explicit tranches** — 10% / 20% / 30% / 40% structure formalized.

### Award Amounts

- **Build Award:** Up to $150,000 in XLM per award
- **Instawards:** Up to $15,000 per project
- **Lifetime cap:** $150K standard, up to $300K case-by-case

## Special Programs

### Kickstart (SCF 6.0 era)

A 5-day virtual bootcamp for early-stage teams, evolved from Startup Camp. Teams received mentorship, refined their submissions, and could receive up to $15K in funding. 83 submissions tracked in the database, with $570,000 in total payouts. Replaced by Instawards in SCF 7.0.

### Public Goods Award

A separate award track for projects providing essential public infrastructure to the Stellar ecosystem — SDKs, security tools, and foundational developer tooling.

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Submissions | 32 |
| Awarded | 31 (96.9% approval rate) |
| Total paid out | $558,489 |
| Rounds | Q3 '25, Q4 '25, Q1 '26 |
| Categories | Developer Tooling, Infrastructure & Services, Applications |

Notable recipients include the Python Stellar SDK, Flutter Stellar SDK, PHP Stellar SDK, iOS Stellar SDK, Java Stellar SDK, Scout (security tool), and Stellar hardware wallet integration.

The near-100% approval rate reflects that these are typically existing, essential ecosystem tools receiving maintenance funding rather than speculative new projects.

### Liquidity Award

Quarterly awards to DeFi protocols providing liquidity infrastructure on Stellar.

| Award Type | Count | Budget | Total Paid |
|---|---|---|---|
| Liquidity Award (Q1 '24) | 10 | $50K–$100K | $300,000 |
| Base Liquidity Award (Q2–Q4 '25) | 4 | $50K flat | $200,000 |
| Supplemental Liquidity Award (Q3 '25) | 1 | $50K | $50,000 |

Notable recipients: Aquarius ($100K), FxDAO ($100K+), Blend Capital ($50K), Soroswap.Finance ($50K), Phoenix ($50K), BondHive ($50K).

All Liquidity Awards target the Financial Protocols category exclusively.
